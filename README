This is a simulator for BÃ¨nard-Marangoni convection based on
spectral elements, pressure correction and BDF2 time stepping.
It utilizes as very fast tensor-product solver for partially-deformed
geometries, making it very useful for performing massive amounts of
simulations to e.g. study the influence of initial conditions.

It uses a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization approach and has been 
optimized to minimize the strain on the interconnect. This makes it suitable
for use on all classes of hardware; be it desktops, clusters or supercomputers.
